This repository contains Lean (version 4.26.0-rc2) files comprising a proof of an augmented version of the Erdős–Faber–Lovász (EFL) conjecture.
The Lean files that are related to Theorem 1 prove that the originally stated EFL is true.
The Lean files that are related to Theorem 2 provide a proven algorithm for identifying a valid EFL coloring more rapidly, than by trying random colorings.
